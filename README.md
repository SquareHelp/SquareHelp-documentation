# SquareHelp
Java, NodeJS and Express frontend, MySQL and Java backend for Codeup Capstone Project



## SquareHelp is designed to be an assistive tool for the smoker who needs extra motivation to quit. The app tool will allow a user to sign up for an account where they have full-access to the member community of individuals who are like them. At setup, the system will require the weekly habit of the smoker in order to pinpoint times of the day where smoker is more susceptible to relapse and reminder smoker to keep to their goal. There is also great "buddy system" messaging tool that can support the user to meet goals by verifying the absence of nicotine in the smoker's daily habit. Lastly, a point system is used to keep track of days spent smoke free along with the average cost saved by continuing this newfound habit and a reward store may be accessed after the required period of time. Overall, SquareHelp can meet the smoker where they are at in their journey to quitting and remind them they are not in this alone.
